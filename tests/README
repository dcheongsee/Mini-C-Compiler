This folders contains a few tests to get us started.
The file minic-stdlib.h is only included so that we can compile these tests using our existing local compiler (e.g. GCC, MSVC).
Note that this header file should be completely ignored by our own compiler.

For instance, we can compile the fibonacci program on Linux by typing:

gcc fibonacci.c -o fibonacci

For more rigorous tests see src/testsX
